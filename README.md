# ðŸ§ª Farmacia Tei - Data Analysis App (Streamlit)

This is a Streamlit web application that analyzes the national expansion potential of Farmacia Tei, a major Romanian pharmacy chain. The project combines business data with geographic and demographic indicators to identify optimal counties for expansion.

## ðŸš€ Functionalities

- ** Dashboard: ** Displays key indicators (turnover, profit, employees) with charts showing their evolution (2014â€“2023).
- ** Expansion Analysis: ** Ranks Romanian counties based on population, income, and pharmacy density. Displays interactive maps and top/bottom 3 counties.
- ** Regression Module: ** Uses multiple linear regression to estimate the expansion score for hypothetical counties based on real indicators.
- ** Clustering: ** Applies KMeans to group counties with similar characteristics (population, income, pharmacy density).
- ** County Comparison: ** Allows side-by-side comparison between any two counties based on selected metrics.
- ** Project Overview Page: ** Brief presentation of the company, founders, and current locations.
